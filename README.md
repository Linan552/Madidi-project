# Madidi-project IN PROGRESS not working currently
Scripts used in analysis of phylogenetic turnover across environmental gradients (elevation in this case)
## intended use 
These scripts represent those used for our recent manucript:   
"The evolutionary assembly of forest communities along environmental gradients: recent diversification or sorting of pre-adapted clades?"   
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.22.424032v1   
Once you have the appropriate packages (see list below) download the entire 02_RegionalAnalyses directory and you should be able to run the scripts within /02_RegionalAnalyses/03_Rcode/ (after specifying the appropriate working directory for you machine). Run the scripts sequentially (01 and 02, 03 ... etc).     
A results folder will be created with figures, stats, etc. 
Note: We have provided a toy dataset (made up of fictional data) to run the scripts. Original data used in our study can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4276558. 

## what each script does
### '01_and_02_make_phylogeny.R' 
uses the tree dataset to generate a time calibrated phylogeny by placing taxa into Smith and Brownâ€™s (2018) global mega-phylogeny of seed plants  (via V.phylomaker)   
INPUTS: 'ToyData_trees.txt' A dataset representing individuals trees surveyed within a set of plots   
OUTPUTS: 
- 'diferrentGeneraList.txt' A list of genera that are not found in the Smith et al's mega phylogeny
- 'tip_info.txt' A table of infomation for each of the "tips" of the phylogeny (species names, genera, family, etc)   
- 'species_data.txt' A list of unique species and morphospecies found within 'ToyData_trees.txt'
- 'phylomaker_phylo_all_S3.tre' phylogeny using scenario 3 (see V.phylomaker manual)
- 'phylomaker_phylo_all_S1.tre' phylogeny using scenario 1 (see V.phylomaker manual)
### '03_turnover_decomposition_2021-01-11.R' 
divides phylogeny into clades based on specified age (30 or 60 my old) and decomposes turnover in two ways (Bray-Curtis and Sorenson), into among- and within-clade components.
INPUTS: 
- 'ToyData_trees.txt' A dataset representing individuals trees surveyed within a set of plots  
- 'ToyData_plots.txt' A dataset containing info about the plots from which trees were surveyed 
- 'phylomaker_phylo_all_S3.tre' or 'phylomaker_phylo_all_S1.tre' Depending on options used   
OUTPUTS: 
- 'BC.total.emp.rds' Bray-Curtis turnover between plots (your empirical data)
- 'S.total.emp.rds' Sorenson turnover between plots (your empirical data)
- 'BC.ag.null.rds'  Bray-Curtis among-clade component (proportion) of turnover
- 'BC.wg.null.rds'  Bray-Curtis within-clade component (proportion) of turnover
- 'BC.BC.ws.null.rds'  Bray-Curtis within-species component (proportion) of turnover
- 'S.ag.null.rds'  Sorenson among-clade component (proportion) of turnover
- 'S.wg.null.rds'  Sorenson within-clade component (proportion) of turnover
